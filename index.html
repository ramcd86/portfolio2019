                        My name is Ross McDermott, and I've been crafting digital experiences out of pixels and variables for almost 15 years. I started humbly, designing and building websites for my gaming passions as a teenager in the mid 00s. I took my passions all the way across the world where I studied Web Design & Development in Ontario, Canada.

                    <p>
                        I am intensely dedicated to creating and delivering polished, rich, and ultimately visually delightful user experiences which both entice the user to interact with my work and to extract meaningful value from it.

                                Scoring yourself and your technological competencies is a challenging affair. It's hard to know where a piece of technology truly ends, and every day you can discover new and unique ways of interacting with a technology. 
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                Web Development is particularly challenging to self-score, as the fundimentals of this field can be learned in a relatively short period of time, but mastering the execution of Web Development via any chosen Stack route can take time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To that end I've created grades for myself to you determine my self-certified competencies in my fields of work:
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>
                                Grade A  - Technically Competent
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                A Grade A technology is a technology I feel I could anser most if not all questions on, barring the occasional piece of potentially obscure knowledge. Grade A demonstrates not only an understand of a techology, but an understanding of methods and implementations of said technologies.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>
                                Grade B - Technically Capable
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                A Grade A technology is a technology I feel that I can competently work in, and with some oversight (or Googling) I could figure out. Grade B technologies are technologies I'd semi-regularly interact with, but would ideally like to have more time with.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>
                                Grade C - Technically Exploring
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                A Grade C technology is a technology I feel I'm still learning, and could not competently execute advanced development in. These are technologies which I would need a significant amount of assistance or research to work in, but technologies I have, no less, worked in.
                            </p>
